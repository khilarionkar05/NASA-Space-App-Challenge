🌸 Bloom Watch – Tracking and Predicting Flowering Events with NASA Data
📌 Overview

Bloom Watch is an interactive web platform that leverages NASA Earth Observation Data (Landsat, MODIS, VIIRS) and citizen science to detect, track, and predict large-scale blooming events in India. The project empowers farmers, ecologists, and city planners with actionable insights on flowering cycles, invasive species, and pollen risks.

🚀 Features

Satellite Data Integration

NDVI & EVI vegetation indices from NASA data.

Spectral signature analysis to detect unique bloom patterns.

Interactive Web Map

Real-time bloom probability heatmap.

Toggle layers: base map, bloom trends, citizen reports.

Citizen Science Component

Users can drop pins with photos of blooms to validate satellite data.

Historical Trends

20+ years of bloom cycle shifts using Landsat archive.

🎯 Use Cases

🌾 Farmers: Predict peak mustard bloom in Rajasthan & Punjab for optimal harvest.

🌿 Ecologists: Detect invasive Lantana camara spread in Western Ghats.

🌬 City Planners & Public Health: Anticipate pollen surges in cities like Bangalore.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python + Google Earth Engine API

Frontend: JavaScript + Leaflet.js

Database: Firebase / Supabase (for user submissions)

Visualization: Interactive charts & bloom heatmaps

📍 Hackathon MVP

Focus on mustard farming in Rajasthan.

Web map showing NDVI trends for the last month.

On-click farm-level historical bloom charts.

Citizen science photo submission form.

🌍 Scalability

Core model adaptable to Southeast Asia and beyond.

Web-first, cloud-ready design.

Multi-scale insights: global satellite data + local citizen reports.

🏁 Next Steps

Validate bloom signals for specific regions (e.g., Valley of Flowers, mustard fields).

Train bloom detection algorithms on historical data.

Expand crowdsourcing to build a global bloom-monitoring community.

👥 Team Roles (Example)

Data & ML: Processing NASA satellite archives.
