Bloom Watch uses NASA Earth data (Landsat, MODIS, VIIRS) and citizen science to track and predict bloom events. Farmers get crop bloom forecasts, ecologists monitor invasive species, and city planners anticipate pollen risks. An interactive web map shows real-time bloom heatmaps and 20+ years of trends.
